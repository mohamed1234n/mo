    <h2>HTML/CSS</h2>

    <p>The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
      HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <img id="foto2"src="./img/Javascript 5.1 en 5.2.png" alt=""/>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated to JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
     All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.</p>

    <h3>PHP</h3>
    <img id="foto3"src="./img/PHP 5.1 en 5.2.jpg" alt=""/>
    <p>PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared toward web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994. The PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page,
       but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>SQL</h3>
    <img id="foto4"src="./img/SQL 5.1 en 5.2.png" alt=""/>
    <p>SQL, (Structured Query Language), is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.</p>
